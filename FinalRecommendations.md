# **Final Recommendation - Why we Recommend Meshtastic?**

### Cost
The devices offer affordable options ranging from $15 to $109, catering to different budgets. With no subscription fees, this makes the product a cost-effective choice for users looking for long-term value.

### Speed
Operating within the 863 - 928 MHz frequency range, these devices are optimized for long-range, low-bandwidth communication, ensuring efficient data transmission over extended distances.

### Distance 
These devices can cover impressive distances, with a range of up to 205 miles for ground-to-ground communication and 128 miles for ground-to-air communication. This distance far exceeds the capabilities of products like goTenna (approximately 100 miles aerial) and ad hoc networks (which typically reach only around 0.06 miles). This makes the devices ideal for use in rural areas with minimal infrastructure.

### End-User Maintenance 
Setting up the devices requires moderate effort as they need hardware configuration. However, no complex networking knowledge is required, and they operate without reliance on cell towers or the internet, providing users with more independence.

### Rural and Urban Requirements
These devices excel in remote, off-grid areas thanks to their long-range capabilities and minimal infrastructure dependencies. While they can also work for local, short-range communication, their performance is optimized in rural settings and may not be as effective in more urban environments. This makes them especially valuable for emergency use in areas with limited infrastructure.

### Recommendations
This device is ideal for rural and remote areas, offering long-range communication (up to 205 miles) with no subscription fees. Itâ€™s affordable, easy to set up, and operates independently of cell towers or the internet. While effective in urban areas for short-range communication, its performance shines in environments with minimal infrastructure, making it perfect for off-grid and emergency use.
