| Infrastructure Independence - operate without relying on existing infrastructure                        | Limited Range per Node: Individual nodes typically have a limited transmission range                              | Extensive Coverage: Satellites can provide communication capabilities in remote and disaster-affected areas  | High Costs: The deployment and operational expenses are high                                                                         | Infrastructure Independence: HF and VHF radios do not rely on existing communication infrastructure  | Limited Data Transmission: These radios are primarily designed for voice communication and offer minimal support for data transmission  | Low Power Consumption: LoRa technology is designed for low energy usage, making it suitable for battery-operated devices  | Limited Data Rates: LoRa supports low data rates, making it unsuitable for applications requiring high-bandwidth transmission  |
| Scalability and Flexibility - Easily expanded by adding more nodes,                                     | Bandwidth Constraints: As data is relayed through multiple nodes, there can be a reduction in data transmission   | Rapid Deployment: Satellite communication systems can be quickly established                                 | Latency Issues: Depending on the satellite's orbit, causes delays in operations.                                                     | Long-Distance Communication: HF radios can cover vast distances                                      | Susceptibility to Interference: HF signals can be affected by atmospheric conditions                                                    | Extended Coverage: Capable of transmitting data over distances up to 10 miles in rural areas                              | Network Management Complexity: can be complex, requiring careful planning and maintenance.                                     |
| Resilience - The decentralized nature ensures that if one node fails, others can reroute communications | Power Dependency: Each node requires a reliable power source                                                      | Independence from Terrestrial Infrastructure: Operates independently of ground-based facilities              | Weather Sensitivity: Adverse weather conditions, such as heavy rain or storms, can disrupt satellite signals, impacting reliability. | Portability: Radio equipment is often portable                                                       | Regulatory Constraints: Operation of these radios often requires specific licenses                                                      | Cost-Effective Deployment                                                                                                 | Interference in Unlicensed Bands:                                                                                              |
