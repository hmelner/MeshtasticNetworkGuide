## Combined Comparative Critera Ranking for all Networks

**Speed**- The maximum speed in megahertz that the network can support.

**Distance** - The maximum distance in miles that the network can reach.

**End-User Maintenance Definition** - The level (easy, moderate, difficult) of dificulty in setting up the network.

**Rural Topography Definition** - How well (easy, moderate, difficult) the network can work in different ranges and dependances respective to Rural Topography.

**Urban Topography Definition** - How well (easy, moderate, difficult) the network can work in different ranges and dependances respective to Urban Topography.
