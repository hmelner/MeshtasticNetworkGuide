Creating any app requires an app developer, and since our objective here is an SMS app that can be accessible to everyone, we can use platforms like React Native or Flutter which can run on both IOS and Android phones. Next we have to install the necessary software for the platform, like Node.js or React Native, to execute code. Then we design the UI for the app, or how it will look for the user, including a page for the chat channels and the threads in each individual chat. After that we implement the different components necessary for an SMS app through code, like sending and receiving messages and accessing SMS features specifically. And finally, we can test and publish the app.

## Key Components of A Messaging App
1) **Authorization -** Give users a personal account, whether it be using a phone number, email, or an app specific user and password login.
2) **Access to Contacts -** In certain apps, we are able to give access to our existing contacts app to transfer that information rather than manually creating new contacts for the new app. This feature would be very useful for a communication app.
3) **Sharing Location -**
4) **Error-Handling -**
5) **SMS Character Limits -**
6) **Time Stamping -**
