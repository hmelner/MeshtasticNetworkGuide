# **Communication Network Comparison and Guide**

### **Overview**
This project delves into the need for reliable communication across various environments, namely for communities without the resources to communicate with one another and outside of the community, and for emergency situations.

### Meshtastic and other Communication Networks
We have included a comparative analysis with a selection of different communication networks, including Meshtastic, Gotenna, Ad Hoc Networks, Yggdrasil, and CJDNS. These networks are organized into a table and ranked by the criteria of cost, speed, distance, end-user maintenance, rural requirements and urban requirements.

### Last Mile Strengths and Weaknesses
The "Last Mile" is the most difficult and expensive part of implementing a rural communication network. In this next section, we have included a strengths and weaknesses analysis for different communication technologies: mesh networks, satellite communication, high frequency/radio, and LoRa.
### Component Budgeting

Creating and maintaining a communication network requires many components including communication infrastructure, hardware parts, software parts, and tools to assemble these parts. This section contains a table consisting of the key components to build a network like meshtastic, along with the budget range for these components, looking into the highest versus lowest cost options for each.

### Communication Network and EAS App-Building Guide
Creating a communication network app can be done in different ways, and this section will go through a guide on SMS and Arduino app-building as well as the key components required for a successfull platform. Adding to this is a guide on how we could approach the implementation of a mass communication emergency alert system into a network like Meshtastic, with a discussion of examples, challenges and an integration strategy. 

### Steps to Implement
Added an instruction files on how to implement steps to implement the communication network.

### Recommendations
Through the research of this information, our team has established some final recommendations, such as our reasons for choosing Meshtastic over other networks, which are included in this section.
